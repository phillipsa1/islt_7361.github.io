          <h4>Artifact #1 Name</h4><br>
           <p>Gap in Sales Performance - Front-End-Analysis, storyboard, and course prototype</p> <br>

   
               <h4>Objective 1.1</h4>  <p>Students are able to design/develop learning opportunities and systems for meaningful learning; promote student engagement in online learning environments; 
                    and select appropriate technology and learning objects to support learners. </p> <br>

               <h4> Description of Artifact</h4><br>
                 <p>This artifact is a 3-module eLearning course created in 9471- Instructional Systems Design. This artifact was created using the Backwards Design/ADDIE model. 
                  It was created to address a gap in sales performance. Upon completion of the program, learners will be able to follow the 5-step new product process, and sell two new products.</p><br>
                  
               <h4>Learning Process</h4><br>
                  <p>This was a great learning experience for me becase I got to apply everything that I learned in class to an authentic scenario that I am an expert in. Therefore, I knew the sceanrio well, which allowed me to soak it all in and enjoy the learning process. Throughout the course my partner and I followed a routine. Each week we would start off by reading all course material.
                  Then we would meet up over Zoom to discuss the material and how we were going to incorporate it into our project. Instead of dividing up the work, we collaborated on each section, and then divided up the work.
                  This helped ensure we were both on the same page and helped us maintain quality and accuracy of our work. My partner on this project was an expereinced instructional designer. So she was the one who suggested 
                  we create a storyboard for our prototype. I had never created a storyboard before, but she taught me how to create them in PowerPoint. It was fascinating. I got so comfortable with them; I completed module-2 by
                  myself in just one day!</p> 
                  <br>
                  
                <h4>My Role</h4><br>
                  <p> This was a group project. My group consisted of two graduate students, which included me, and my partner. My role within the group was team leader, to come up with the scenario and play the part of subject matter expert or SME.
                  I oversaw all meetings, created content, storyboards, graphics and all calculations. </p>
                  <br>
                  
                <h4>Reflection</h4><br> 
                  <p>When I entered this class, I set two professional goals for myself that I wanted to achieve by the time I completed the course. The first goal I set for myself 
                    was to gain a solid understanding of the ADDIE lifecycle. The second goal was to gain a solid understanding of the learning theories. In looking back, I can safely say this course taught
                    me all that and then some! I have a concrete understanding of ADDIE and the processes associated with each phase. And a solid understanding of adult learning thoery, and application.
                      Although this course was challenging at times. I am walking away with crucial knowledge and skills I know I will use every day in my future role as an ID. </p><br>

      <h4>Artifact #2 Name</h4><br> 
      <p>Developing a Growth Mindset VILT</p><br>

     <h4>Objective 1.2</h4><br>
          <p>Students are able to design, develop, implement, and evaluate an online learning activity that
            includes student assessment.
          </p><br>

     <h4> Description of Artifact</h4><br>
         <p>This artifact is a VILT course I created in 9484- Teaching Online Courses during the Summer of 2022. 
           This course teaches learners how they can develop a growth mindset over time.
        </p><br>

     <h4>Learning Process</h4><br>
       <p>This was the first VILT course I had ever created. And it was my first time implementing an online course. 
          After writing my research proposal on social-emotional learning. I became interested in the curricula used to develop elementary 
          students social-emotional skills. So, I decided to create my first course on growth mindset. One of the requirements of this assignment
          was to create a course for students in K-12 education. So, I designed this course for students in the 4-5th grade.  After creating my course objectives, I created the assessments, 
          learning strategies and made sure they all aligned. Then I proceeded to create the content on each slide and rehears my lines. In the end, my course was 
          a success. Everyone that joined my SIS provided me with a positive evaluation and said that while they thought it was a great course for 4-5th grade students, 
          the content was versitile enough to be beneficial for adults too.
       </p><br>

     <h4>My Role</h4><br>
         <p>This was an independent project, so I oversaw all  aspects of the project by myself. I selected a topic, 
         researched, and collected content. I created the presentation using PowerPoint. Implemented it in Zoom, and edited the final
         video in Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><br>

     <h4>Reflection</h4><br> 
        <p class="last">This was my first VILT ever created, and implemented. So, I was pretty nervous. I taught myself to use Zoom, practiced and
         rehearsed my lines a million times. And even though I had designed and interactive and engaging course.  I had not accounted
         for technical difficulties. During my presentation I could not see any of my peers faces. This threw me off, and I wound up 
         butchering a few of the slides. But I kept my cool and found a way to make it work. Instead of relying on their facial expressions.
         I calmly explained what was going on, and asked my audience to verbalize their responses. While this presentation did not go quite 
         the way I had planned it to. I enjoyed the process and learned a lot from it. In the future, before I give an online presentation. 
         I will be sure to practice my presentation using the software, so I don't make the same mistake twice.</p><br><br>

      <h4>Artifact #3 Name</h4>
      <p>Smart Sheet/Project Plan</p> <br>

      <h4>Objective 1.1</h4> <br>
          <p>Smart Sheet Gantt chart, timeline, schedules, and budget for 8-course employee onboarding project.</p><br>


      <h4> Description of Artifact</h4><br>
          <p>This artifact demonstrates my ability to use Smart Sheet Pm software to plan and oversee a complex ID project. 
            I created this artifact in 9473- Project Management during the Spring of 2022. Here I designed and managed an
            eight-course onboard training program. The courses consist of six-1-hour eLearning modules using low-level-3 
            interactivity. And two-6-hour (ILT) or instructor lead training courses. </p><br>

      <h4>Learning Process</h4><br>
           <p>This project allowed me to get up close and personal with all the major phases of the PM lifecycle. As we learned in class,
            I took a complex project and broke it down into smaller manageable steps. Which made it easy. I took it slow and learned to 
            use Smart Sheet before creating each phase. I created my projects WBS or work breakdown structure and went from there. As I 
            worked through the project initiation, planning, executing, monitoring, and closure phases. I realized PM software made managing
            timelines, schedules, and budgets across multiple projects easy.  </p><br>

      <h4>My Role</h4><br>
           <p>This was a solo project, so I completed everything autonomously. I constructed my PM documentation. Gantt charts, timelines, WBS,
            budgets, schedules, and planned for contingencies. I enjoyed creating this project by myself because I was able to expereince what
            project management is all about. </p><br>

      <h4>Reflection</h4><br> 
           <p class="last">I took this course during my first semester at Mizzou. And I was so glad I did. Because it equipped me with tips, and tricks that I
            find myself using almost every day. In the beginning of this course, I was unfamiliar with the ADDIE lifecycle. So, I had to conduct 
            a lot of outside research to create an authentic project. During my research I discovered Brian Chapman and Karl Kapp’s ADT research. 
            And applied it to my project. Now I know how to estimate, gauge, and plan real ID projects with accuracy. Which is something I know I
            will use often in my future career as an ID. </p><br>
