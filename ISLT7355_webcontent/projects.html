          <h4>Artifact</h4><br>
           <p>Gap in Sales Performance - Front-End-Analysis documentation, storyboard, formative/summative assessments, and written course prototype</p> <br>

   
               <h4>Objective 1.1</h4>  <p>Students are able to design/develop learning opportunities and systems for meaningful learning; promote student engagement in online learning environments; 
                    and select appropriate technology and learning objects to support learners. </p> <br>

               <h4> Description of Artifact</h4><br>
                 <p>This artifact is a 3-module eLearning course created in 9471- Instructional Systems Design. This artifact was created using the 
                  Backwards Design/ADDIE model to address a gap in sales performance.
                   Upon completion of the program, learners will be able to follow the 5-step new product process and sell two new products.</p><br>
                  
               <h4>Learning Process</h4><br>
                  <p>This was a great learning experience for me because I got to apply everything that I learned in class to an authentic scenario in a field I am an expert in. Therefore, I knew the scenario well, which afforded me the opportunity to have fun and ejoy the learning process. Throughout the course my partner and I followed a routine. Each week we would start off by reading all course material.
                  Then we would meet up over Zoom to discuss the material and how we were going to incorporate it into our project. Instead of dividing up the work, we collaborated on each section, and then divided up the work.
                  This helped ensure we were both on the same page and helped us maintain the quality and accuracy of our work. My partner on this project was an expereinced instructional designer. So she was the one who suggested 
                  we create a storyboard for our prototype. I had never created a storyboard before, but she taught me how to create them in PowerPoint. It was fascinating. I got so comfortable with them; I completed module-2 by
                  myself in just one day!</p> 
                  <br>
                  
                <h4>My Role</h4><br>
                  <p> This was a group project. My group consisted of two graduate students, which included me, and my partner. My role within the group was team leader, and subject matter expert or SME.
                  I oversaw all meetings, created content, storyboards, and graphics calculations, and came up with the scenario.</p>
                  <br>
                  
                <h4>Reflection</h4><br> 
                  <p>When I entered this class, I set two professional goals for myself that I wanted to achieve by the time I completed the course. The first goal I set for myself 
                    was to gain a solid understanding of the ADDIE lifecycle. The second goal was to gain a solid understanding of the learning theories. In looking back, I can safely say this course taught
                    me all that and then some! I have a concrete understanding of ADDIE and the processes associated with each phase. And a solid understanding of adult learning theory, and application.
                      Although this course was challenging at times. I am walking away with crucial knowledge and skills I know I will use every day in my future role as an ID. </p><br>

                     <p>Students will apply principles of rapid development and use Adobe Captivate
                         rapid authoring tool to create a prototype of an e-learning module that uses
                         technology features that can enhance the user's learning experience.

                     <p>Retail Sales Training: Techniques for sales success eLearning module storyboard, functional prototype, and quick-pitch video.</p><br>
                       
              

                            <h4> Description of Artifact</h4><br>   
                            <p>This artifact contains both my storyboard and my “quick pitch” video created in 7383-Rapid Development. Here the quick-pitch video showcases and describes my capstone 
                              course prototype. The eLearning module was designed to close a gap in skills at a fictitious company called “iTell Wireless.”  Though Adobe Captivate did
                               not allow me to keep the fully functioning prototype I created during the free trial, I now have a prototype for my capstone project which I plan to build in 
                               Articulate 360 during my final semester. </p><br>

                            <h4>Learning Process</h4><br>
                            <p>This course started off with a crash course in instructional design essentials including the Rapid Development design framework. Then we moved onto rapid 
                              prototyping where I built my storyboard which contained all course content, before moving onto scripting for my animated demos. With scripts in place,
                               I personally fashioned animations using vector graphics from FreePik.com. Converting these to EMF files, I harnessed PowerPoint and Speechelo A.I. 
                               voice generative software for each character, before exporting to MP4.</p><br>

                               <p>After I had the MP4 I used Adobe Premiere Pro to add transitions, 
                               consistent branding, and speed audio and video playback to each video. Once the animations were complete, I moved on to creating my branched scenarios. I went with the proven 3-C’s 
                               method and leveraged ChatGPT to formulate dialogues and drew from my sales acumen to shape nuanced challenges, choices, and consequences. After I had all
                                my content, I dove into the world of Adobe Captivate, and built my first interactive eLearning course! </p><br>
                            
                            <h4>My Role</h4><br>
                            <p>This was another solo project, so I designed and developed this course myself.</p><br>

                            <h4>Reflection</h4><br> 
                              <p>In looking back, I think this was one of the most important courses of my entire program. Not only did I learn the rapid development design framework.
                               I also learned how to create software simulations, branched scenarios, incorporate animations, provide remediation after failed quiz attempts, and was provided with an in-depth 
                               crash course on Adobe Captivate. I was also shown how to set up advanced actions using variables and IF THEN ELSE statements to include
                                simple scripting for complex user interactions and interactivity to my courses.  </p><br>

<h3> Objective 2.1 </h3><br> 
<p>Students will utilize the step-by-step microlearning instructional guide to create a microlearning
   asset using the microlearning design framework and building process.</p><br>


<h4> Artifact</h4><br>
<p> First-Contact-Resolution (FCR) Microlearning asset. </p><br>

<h4>Description of artifact</h4><br>
  <p>First-Contact-Resolution (FCR) course was developed for a fictitious company in 7386- Microlearning to increase customer service representatives (CSR) FCR rates. 
    I created a scenario where this “company” had created and trained an FCR policy, and then we use this microlearning asset to help implement the new 
    FCR policy. This asset includes three learning layers which include: (1) a short video to generate excitement and demonstrate the importance of FCR policy;
    (2) an on-demand micro course so learners can quickly gather the information they need while on the go; and (3) an infographic to place on their wall by 
    each CSR to ensure they utilize the 5-step FCR framework with each customer to increase their individual and aggregate FCR rates leading to lower 
    employee/customer churn rates and increasing company profits.
  </p><br>

<h4>Learning Process</h4><br>

<h4>My Role</h4><br>
<p>This was an independent project, so I designed and developed this microlearning asset myself. </p><br>

      <h4>Artifact</h4><br> 
      <p>Developing a Growth Mindset VILT</p><br>

     <h4> Description of Artifact</h4><br>
         <p>This artifact is a VILT course I created in 9484- Teaching Online Courses during the Summer of 2022. 
           This course teaches learners how they can develop a growth mindset over time.
        </p><br>

     <h4>Learning Process</h4><br>
       <p>This was the first VILT course I had ever created. And it was my first time implementing an online course. 
          After writing my research proposal on social-emotional learning. I became interested in the curricula used to develop elementary 
          students' social-emotional skills. So, I decided to create my first course on growth mindset. One of the requirements of this assignment
          was to create a course for students in K-12 education. So, I designed this course for students in the 4-5th grade.  After creating my course objectives, I created the assessments, 
          and learning strategies and made sure they all aligned. Then I proceeded to create the content on each slide and rehearsed my lines. In the end, my course was 
          a success. Everyone that joined my SIS provided me with a positive evaluation and said that while they thought it was a great course for 4-5th grade students, 
          the content was versatile enough to be beneficial for adults too.
       </p><br>

     <h4>My Role</h4><br>
         <p>This was an independent project, so I oversaw all  aspects of the project by myself. I selected a topic, 
         researched, and collected content. I created the presentation using PowerPoint. Implemented it in Zoom, and edited the final
         video in Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><br>

     <h4>Reflection</h4><br> 
        <p class="last">This was my first VILT ever created, and implemented. So, I was pretty nervous. I taught myself to use Zoom, practiced and
         rehearsed my lines a million times. And even though I had designed an interactive and engaging course.  I had not accounted
         for technical difficulties. During my presentation, I could not see any of my peer's faces. This threw me off, and I wound up 
         butchering a few of the slides. But I kept my cool and found a way to make it work. Instead of relying on their facial expressions.
         I calmly explained what was going on, and asked my audience to verbalize their responses. While this presentation did not go quite 
         the way I had planned it to. I enjoyed the process and learned a lot from it. In the future, before I give an online presentation. 
         I will be sure to practice my presentation using the software, so I don't make the same mistake twice.</p><br><br>

      <h4>Artifact</h4>
      <p>Smart Sheet/Project Plan</p> <br>

      <h4>Objective 1.1</h4> <br>
          <p>Smart Sheet Gantt chart, timeline, schedules, and budget for 8-course employee onboarding project.</p><br>


      <h4> Description of Artifact</h4><br>
          <p>This artifact demonstrates my ability to use Smart Sheet Pm software to plan and oversee a complex ID project. 
            I created this artifact in 9473- Project Management during the Spring of 2022. Here I designed and managed an
            eight-course new-employee onboard training program. The program consists of six-1-hour eLearning modules using low-level-3 
            interactivity. And two-6-hour (ILT) or instructor-led training courses. </p><br>

      <h4>Learning Process</h4><br>
           <p>This project allowed me to get up close and personal with all the major phases of the PM lifecycle. As we learned in class,
            I took a complex project and broke it down into smaller manageable steps. Which made it easy. I took it slow and learned to 
            use Smart Sheet before creating each phase. I created my project WBS or work breakdown structure and went from there. As I 
            worked through the project initiation, planning, executing, monitoring, and closure phases. I realized PM software made managing
            timelines, schedules, and budgets across multiple projects easy.  </p><br>

      <h4>My Role</h4><br>
           <p>This was a solo project, so I completed everything autonomously. I constructed my PM documentation. Gantt charts, timelines, WBS,
            budgets, schedules, and planned for contingencies. I enjoyed creating this project by myself because I was able to experience what
            project management is all about. </p><br>

      <h4>Reflection</h4><br> 
           <p class="last">I took this course during my first semester at Mizzou. And I was so glad I did. Because it equipped me with tips, and tricks that I
            find myself using almost every day. At the beginning of this course, I was unfamiliar with the ADDIE lifecycle. So, I had to conduct 
            a lot of outside research to create an authentic project. During my research, I discovered Brian Chapman and Karl Kapp’s ADT research. 
            And applied it to my project. Now I know how to estimate, gauge, and plan real ID projects with accuracy. Which is something I know I
            will use often when planning and overseeing ISD projects. </p><br>
