  <h4 class="PRh4">How I got here</h4>
    <p class="para1"> I was first introduced to the thoery of instructional design during my 
      undergraduate studies in human resource management class. There, I was asked to apply the
       theory of instructional design by creating multiple interactive PowerPoint Presentations
       for use in employee training programs. I created my first two courses on the topics of
        wrongful termination and employee training, and I fell in love! So, I began researching the
         industry. I took a few courses on LinkedIn, and Udemy, and joined some instructional design
          social media groups just to make sure ID was the right role for me. After researching the
           industry for several months. I found that instructional design combines everything I love 
           in one neat package. So, I went ahead and enrolled in MUs' Learning 
           Technologies and Design program. And the more I learn, the more I am certain I am going 
           to love what I do.


    </p><br>
 
    <h4 class="PRh4">Where I am</h4>
    <p> 
      When I first began my program, I was not familiar with the ADDIE process and had no clue what
       each phase entailed. All I knew was that I wanted to work in L&D as an instructional designer.
        Yet, I had no idea how to complete front-end analysis, write objectives and little expereince
         creating courses. But all of that changed. I am halfway through my program, and so far, it 
         has been amazing! Each one of the artifacts in my portfolio reflects my professional growth 
         and development in my journey to become an instructional designer. 
   </p><br>
 
 
   <h4 class="PRh4">What I have Learned</h4>
   <p > 
    This program has been very hands-on and I have gotten experience working through each phase of 
    the ADDIE, rapid development, and microlearning life cycle. I have learned to conduct Front-End analysis, look for and identify discrepancies to
     close knowledge gaps through a variety of learning and training modalities. I now know how to design and
      conduct formative and summative assessment/evaluation and have gained a solid understanding of
       adult learning theory. Now, I feel confident in my abilities to write objectives and use 
       Backwards Design to ensure my objectives, assessments, and learning strategies are well 
       aligned, and so much more! With each class I am slowly, but surely becoming an informed
        instructional designer. Equipped with the basic tools, knowledge and know-how needed to 
        create professional courses. 
    </p><br>
 
  
   <h4 class="PRh4">Where I am going</h4>
    <p>
      After graduation I plan to use my new skills to begin a career in instructional design building
       quality training instructions that can be delivered both in-person or online. I want to work
        on a design team for a large corporation as their in-house training specialist, or as an
         instructional design consultant and work under contract for a variety of businesses to help
          them achieve their training goals and objectives. I know a career in instructional design
           will keep me stimulated intellectually and challenged professionally. I know it will allow me the opportunity
           to triangulate and locate problem areas so I can use my skills to create meaningful 
           training programs that help to cut organizational inefficiencies while simultaneously
            making a positive impact in thousands of trainees lives. While I am proud of the work 
            accomplished so far, I am excited about my future and the opportunities that lie ahead.
